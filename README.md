# Book Recommendation
U created a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors.I have used the Book-Crossings dataset. This dataset contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.
After importing and cleaning the data, I used NearestNeighbors from sklearn.neighbors to develop a model that shows books that are similar to a given book. The Nearest Neighbors algorithm measures the distance to determine the “closeness” of instances.
